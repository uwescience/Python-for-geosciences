## 2018-02-06. Python as a tool to build large-scale geoscience systems - An example on a hydrologic data assimilation system

**[Yixin Mao](http://uw-hydro.github.io/current_member/yixin_mao), UW Civil and Environmental Engineering, [Hydro | Computational Hydrology group](http://uw-hydro.github.io/)**

In this seminar I will present an example of using Python to build large-scale geoscience systems. In the first part of the seminar, I will present a hydrologic data assimilation system that greatly benefits from Python as a building tool. The second part of the seminar will focus on system speedup, including lessons I learned and demonstration of some strategies.

*The presentation is available at Yixin's Github pages, [here](https://github.com/yixinmao/Python_Seminar_2018Feb/tree/master).*
